# LIBERTAS :peace_symbol: :fox_face:

***A social network where nobody gets cancelled, de-platformed, or bullied. Say what YOU want to say!*** :peace_symbol: :fox_face:

## ABOUT :books:

Since I saw that governments and social media companies are de-platforming or outright cancelling people for uttering controversial views or views that do not fit in with the mainstream narrative of lies and deceit, I thought I'd create a social network that lets anyone say whatever they want, anywhere. You can do on here whatever the hell you want. I will not step in your way and should this become larger, neither will anyone else.

## USAGE :pick:

Getting started with using ***Libertas*** is easy.
-  Make an account, click the `New Bit` button, write something, add a picture if you want, and send it off.
-  Congratulations! You just made your first "Bit"! A "Bit" is what we call a "Tweet" but Twitter is a taboo platform so we don't mention their name. (Except in this instance.)
- To follow someone while logged in, add their username after `/profile/` part.
- To share your public profile on ***Libertas*** simply append `/user/yourusername` to the end of the ***Libertas*** root URL.
- If you click the `timeline` button, you can see all the "Bits" of all the users you have followed.
