# LIBERTAS :peace_symbol: :fox_face:

***A social network where nobody gets cancelled, de-platformed, or bullied. Say what YOU want to say!*** :peace_symbol: :fox_face:

## ABOUT :books:

Since I saw that governments and social media companies are de-platforming or outright cancelling people for uttering controversial views or views that do not fit in with the mainstream narrative of lies and deceit, I thought I'd create a social network that lets anyone say whatever they want, anywhere. You can do on here whatever the hell you want. I will not step in your way and should this become larger, neither will anyone else.

## WARNING :warning:

This project is still under active development.
You can find a list of things still to implement, [here](TODO.markdown).
